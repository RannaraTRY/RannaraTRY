# About me

Hi everyone, my name is Rannara and my moniker is: RannaraTRY. Under this name you won't be able to find much anywhere, as I decided to change it. I like art, web3 technology and the idea of it, I like NFT. I have quite a large pool of things that interest me! You can see for yourself by checking out my social networks! I also like to write guides on projects that I have personally figured out. Here are 3 guides I've written that you might find useful! I put them on Medium on purpose, so that the audience reach would be bigger) Go and rate them!
